## Adherence during a pandemic

Chrystelle Kiang Dissertation Aim 3

### Note space

Here goes my attempt at using quarto for some of this dissertation aim text. This first section is just a note space and then the actual body will be later?

First, want to get descriptive statistics. I am using the cancer_subset dataset for now, but in the future should be able to actually read in the combined one and then just subset those based on distinct StudyID.

```{r}
#| include: false
library(here) 
library(tidyverse)
library(arsenal)
# gtsummary not installing 
# library(gtsummary)

studydata <- readRDS("studypopdata.rds")

n_studypop <- studydata %>% 
  distinct(StudyID) %>%
  n_distinct()

studypop <- studydata %>%
  distinct(StudyID, .keep_all = TRUE)

table(studydata$drug_category)

# these may be more useful later for any sort of bias analysis
# eligiblepop <- readRDS("GCRcancer_eligible.rds")
# create the statistics to show 
# n_ER <- eligiblepop %>% 
#  distinct(StudyID) %>%
#  n_distinct()

# for table 1 may need to create new dataset with all the summaries; or just assign name for each?
```

### Results

There are `n_studypop` patients who had ER positive tumors, diagnosed stages I to III, and had a prescription starting on January 1, 2018.
