## Adherence during a pandemic

Chrystelle Kiang Dissertation Aim 3

### Note space

Here goes my attempt at using quarto for some of this dissertation aim text. This first section is just a note space and then the actual body will be later?

First, want to get descriptive statistics. I am using the cancer_subset dataset for now, but in the future should be able to actually read in the combined one and then just subset those based on distinct StudyID.

```{r}
#| include: false
library(here) 
library(tidyverse)
# library(arsenal)
# gtsummary not installing 
# library(gtsummary)

# this is all prescriptions for eligible study population
pharmstudydata <- readRDS("studypopdata.rds")
# will subset further to actual analytic dataset

unique_pharmdata <- pharmstudydata %>% 
  distinct(StudyID)

# will want to look at prescriptions per person
# only keep one drug per patient
drugsbystudyID <- pharmstudydata %>%
  distinct(StudyID, drug_name) 
  #select(StudyID, drug_name)

drugs_wide <- drugsbystudyID %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = drug_name, values_from = drug_name, values_fn = length, values_fill = 0)# need to create studyID indicator or something


#TODO create drug variable that is binary if the 4 we are interested in and have these tables again. 

########

# unique_drugs %>% group_by(drug_name) %>% summarise(StudyID = n())
people_with_multiple_drugs <- drugsbystudyID %>% 
  group_by(StudyID) %>% 
  summarise(unique_drugs = n_distinct(drug_name)) %>%
  filter(unique_drugs > 1)

# one line per patient
studypop <- studydata %>%
  distinct(StudyID, .keep_all = TRUE)

# just the number of prescriptions for main drugs of interest
table(studydata$drug_name, useNA = "always")


# for table 1 may need to create new dataset with all the summaries; or just assign name for each?
```

### Results

There are `n_studypop` patients who had ER positive tumors, diagnosed stages I to III, and had any prescription starting on January 1, 2018.
