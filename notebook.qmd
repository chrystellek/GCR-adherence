Convo with Kevin (3/7)

1.  Tumor record number (in data file) and changed to first filter by ER+ then min tumor number based on KW email response: SeqNum will be added and then I will update and filter by SeqNum, below. Selected for min SeqNum.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| label: seq-vs-tumor-number

# Reading datasets in. These are R version of csv file; don't want to edit.
GCRpop <- readRDS("./data/cancerstudypop.rds")
# this dataset has not been filtered by SEQNo but the studypop is
table(GCRpop$SEQNo, GCRpop$CTCTUMOR_RECORD_NUMBER)

GCRpop_min <- GCRpop %>%
  filter(SEQNo == min(SEQNo)) 

GCRpop2 <- GCRpop %>%
  filter(SEQNo == min(SEQNo)) %>%
  group_by(StudyID, SEQNo) %>%
  summarise(n_tumor = n_distinct(CTCTUMOR_RECORD_NUMBER))

# rural urban
rur <- study_pop %>%
  group_by(StudyID) %>%
  slice(n())

```

3.  AI or tamoxifen before diagnosis date: the handful we looked at are second breast cancers. May filter/report Seq Num
4.  Small numbers: supress cells \<5 and rates for \<15
5.  Urban/rural variables: will be added and uploaded. Census and county level.
6.  Race and ethnicity: NH-White, NH-Black, Hisp/Lat. can see what other races Hisp/Lat overlap.

Below is code to test code that I'd like to put in results eventually.

Notes from data cleaning:

-   **Drug groups:** There were some people with both drug groups (AI and TAM). There are valid reasons that people would switch. 1) AI to TAM for pre-meno who then start menopause. 2) TAM to AI if postmeno have bad side effects (Convo with Tim 2/6) --\> included both.

    -   Also decided to look at all adjuvant endocrine therapy as one category, at least for now, as opposed to AI and TAM separately (could do that later).

-   **Prescription timing:** Some had prescription before diagnosis date. People can be prescribed TAM to shrink tumor before surgery (neoadjuvant) -\> excluded them entirely.

    -   Open questions: what is the source for date of diagnosis? (E.g., is date of diagnosis overridden at surgery vs. biopsy to explain prescription *before* dx)

-   **Tumor record number:** Q about tumor record number vs. sequence number for repeated tumors

    -   Tim thinks it's odd that 0 bilateral- still maybe related to tumor record number
    -   Update from KW: should be using SeqNum; tumor number is for each specific one hence why no bilateral. Will get SeqNum soon.

**Continuous Medication Availability (CMA)**: AdhereR package, largely based on Vollmer et al.

-   CMA1 is the total days supply, excluding last dispense event, in observation window/duration between first to last dispense event.

-   CMA1 is total days supply, excluding last dispense event, in observation window/duration between first to last event.

-   CMA2 is similar to CMA1 but *includes* last dispense event and time is based on the observation window (OW) specified. Not sure how the OW works when CMA2 used with sliding window. Package authors say that CMA2 includes duration of last event in numerator, and duration between start of last event to end of OW in denominator, which accounts for medication event happening before/after previous supply is finished.

-   CMA3 is CMA1 capped at 1.0

-   CMA4 is CMA2 capped at 1.0

-   CMA7 is \# days theoretical use/observation window period, where gap days between dispenses are not included in time interval; so this allows for carryover and excludes the left over supply

-   CMA8 is \# days theoretical use/observation window *with lagged start*, where gap days are not included in time interval, and the lag is the days of carry over supply

-   CMA9 is (# observation window days weighted by ratio of days supply)/observation window. This means carry over and extra supply is evenly spread until next event. Using this with sliding window presents an issue because it assigns a CMA to periods when the patient should be NA/too long after their episode has ended. It is good at estimating a CMA during gaps though; it's not perfect but ultimately less than 80% which is what really matters.

Feb 19: After reading more into Vollmer et al. (2012), I am not convinced that MPR is what we want to plot. MPR seems to be better suited for longer intervals (e.g., if wanted 6-months or whole study period) rather than what we're trying to consider. Proportion of days covered may actually be of interest. Vollmer suggests MDC is more indicator of medication dispense/whether refills obtained, which is what we're interested in as well though. **Will need to** **discuss/defend choice.**

Summary of notes from before: Had a lot of back and forth about which CMAs to use and trouble with the OW duration varying between patients. With CMA 1-4, got a lot of 1 or NA, then CMA 5-9, got 0's after last dispense until OW end, which made it seem like artificial non-adherence. The CMAs 5-9 would correctly classify as NA before the first dispenses.

-   unresolved thought from before: may need to quantify the number missing and whether it's because they stopped treatment early vs. should have stopped. But that is a question of persistence, not adherence.

My current solution is to run Sliding Window CMA function for each patient to allow for variation in OW. Set the follow up (FU) start before the study period start of Jan 1, 2018 to allow for calculation of adherence for the month of January 2018 if they were completing a fill.

### Interrupted Time Series

I've seen two versions of interrupted time series formulas:

-   Option 1: Y \~ $\beta_{0}$time + $\beta_{1}$COVID + $\beta_{2}$time \* COVID

-   Option 2: Y \~ $\beta_{0}$time + $\beta_{1}$COVID + $\beta_{2}$time since COVID start

where:

-   $\beta_{1}$ = trend before COVID

-   $\beta_{2}$ = level of change right after start of COVID

-   $\beta_{3}$ = trend after COVID

Okay now doing the ITS, comparing March and April as COVID dates. April allows for lag between start of COVID and when it would actually impact people whose prescriptions had not yet run out when the pandemic started and before Georgia actually imposed restrictions.

```

They look very similar whether April or March used. Also looks similar in terms of beta values and overall (lack of) trends when we re-center 0 to peoples' first fill after COVID.

For now, just trying what I think is 2 waves each year (13 x 4 weeks = 52 weeks) and I think we'd be looking for change between periods 2 and 3, but not very different. Looks like there is a change over time though.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| label: its-spline

# window.ID is time variable
library(splines)

# mortality data use (number of calendar years x 7) – 1
# Dominici et al., cited by Bhaskaran et al.
cma5_sp <- bs(cma5_data$window.ID, degree = 3, df = 27)

its_sp <- glm(prop_adherent ~ cma5_sp, data = cma5_data, family = "gaussian")
  
cma5_data$sp_fit = predict(its_sp)

ggplot(cma5_data, aes(x = window.start, y = prop_adherent)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(aes(y = sp_fit), colour = "blue", linewidth = 1) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = COVID_start, colour = "red") +
  labs(title = "Spline", x = "Year", y = "Proportion Adherent (80%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1)) 

summary(its_sp)
```

The regression output suggests some differences in time periods, but need to learn more about splines and how they map to which time intervals.

#### Workflow for subsetting:

1.  create list of StudyIDs to filter on
2.  filter the cma output by StudyIDs from above
3.  optional but do the run_CMA function to summarize, do ITS, and plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false 
#| label: subsets
# demographic and clinical info 
demo <- study_pop %>%
  group_by(StudyID) %>%
  slice(n()) %>%
  select(StudyID, CTCDATE_OF_DIAGNOSIS_YYYY, ERstatus, stage_summary, drug_group, sex:reporting_source) 

pdc_white <- demo %>%
  filter(race_collapsed == "White") %>%
  left_join(cma5_original, by = "StudyID") %>%
  get_cma_results(april_start)

pdc_white$reg_summary
pdc_white$reg_plot + 
labs(title = "White race 4-week PDC", x = "Year", y = "Proportion Adherent (80%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1)) 


```

Overall, the betas are pretty much 0.

![Figure from Turner et al.](./data/TurnerFigure1.png)

Trying to set time 0 to the first fill post-pandemic and re-align. Not quite interrupted time series... but same principle applies. X axis will vary depending on when fills are in that time. Not sure if I should run CMA's separately for before and after? For now, just using the same output and reshaping.

In order to do this pre/post comparison, may need to subset to people who have prescriptions before and after. For now, setting COVID as time 0 if they do not have it.

cma5_new0 <- cma5_new %>%
    mutate(adherent = case_when(
    CMA >= 0.80 ~ 1,
    CMA < 0.80 ~ 0),
    new_window_ID = window.ID - post_weekID) %>% 
    # grouping by new window ID to align everyone's time 0 
  group_by(new_window_ID) %>%
  reframe(adherent_count = sum(adherent == 1, na.rm = TRUE), 
            non_adherent_count = sum(adherent == 0, na.rm = TRUE),
            adherent_NA_count = sum(is.na(adherent)),
            prop_adherent = mean(adherent, na.rm = TRUE),
            prop_NA = adherent_NA_count/(adherent_NA_count + adherent_count + adherent_NA_count),
          inverse_prop_NA = 1 - prop_NA,
          post_COVID = if_else(new_window_ID >= 0, 1, 0)) %>%
  distinct()

its_cma5_new0 <- lm(prop_adherent ~ new_window_ID + post_COVID + new_window_ID*post_COVID, data = cma5_new0)
summary(its_cma5_new0)
# have 12 missing

# omitting the time windows that are missing prop_adherent
cma5_new2 <- cma5_new0 %>% na.omit(prop_adherent) %>%
  mutate(total_count = adherent_count + non_adherent_count + adherent_NA_count)
  
cma5_new2$fit <- predict(its_cma5_new0)

plot_COVID_centered <- ggplot(cma5_new2, aes(x = new_window_ID, y = prop_adherent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit), colour = "blue", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour = "red") +
  labs(title = "4-week PDC (CMA5)", x = "Weeks relative to first post-pandemic prescription end", y = "Proportion Adherent (80%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1)) 

cma5_plot / cma5_april_plot / plot_COVID_centered
summary(april_its)
summary(march_its)
summary(its_cma5_new0)
```

Overall, they look similar: between March vs. April start vs. resetting everyone to first prescription post-COVID (independent of calendar year). For now, may stick to March or April. The other way is hard to interpret.

Curious what happens if we subset to only those who have a first dispense before pandemic.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| label: rx-preCOVID

cma5_post_subset <- cma5_original %>%
  left_join(IDlist, by = "StudyID") %>%
  filter(first_dispense < COVID_start) 

# n_distinct(cma5_post_subset$StudyID) 
# 7396... so most patients did start before pandemic 
cma5_post_summary <- cma5_post_subset %>%
    mutate(adherent = case_when(
    CMA >= 0.80 ~ 1,
    CMA < 0.80 ~ 0)) %>%
    # grouping by new window ID to align everyone's time 0 
  group_by(window.ID, window.start) %>%
  reframe(adherent_count = sum(adherent == 1, na.rm = TRUE), 
            non_adherent_count = sum(adherent == 0, na.rm = TRUE),
            adherent_NA_count = sum(is.na(adherent)),
            prop_adherent = mean(adherent, na.rm = TRUE),
            prop_NA = adherent_NA_count/(adherent_NA_count + adherent_count + adherent_NA_count),
          inverse_prop_NA = 1 - prop_NA,
          post_COVID = if_else(window.start >= COVID_start, 1, 0)) %>%
  distinct()

its_cma5_subset <- lm(prop_adherent ~ window.ID + post_COVID + window.ID*post_COVID, data = cma5_post_summary)
summary(its_cma5_subset)

cma5_post_summary$fit <- predict(its_cma5_subset)
COVID_window <- as.Date("2020-03-23", format = "%Y-%m-%d")
ggplot(cma5_post_summary, aes(x = window.start, y = prop_adherent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit), colour = "blue", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = COVID_start, colour = "red") +
  labs(title = "4-week PDC (CMA5)", x = "Time", y = "Proportion Adherent (80%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5,1)) 
```
Again, looks similar to before.

Started to try to calculate MPR myself... didn't get very far. If I were to would:

-   first for each patient, get MPR for each dispense date (and then set a min MPR, 1 - capped variable) then then later create dates dataset that seeks if there is an MPR in that week, to use it. THEN can add a check that if there was an MPR within 90 days it is 0, and if not it is NA. because those people are still in treatment episode.

    -   group by studyID and get +/- 1 event in dispenses

-   loop through each week, seek for dispense date within that week. - carry over based on days supply
